1. make the form in "signup" using onchange event handler on all the input fields and onsubmit on the actual form tag ,also using useState

2. also solved the problem of global error handler in auth.controller.js

3.also use 'useNavigate' to go to sign in after signup shows no error (from "reactrouterdom")
